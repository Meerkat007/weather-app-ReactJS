# weather-app-ReactJS

This weather website is a project for practicing ReactJS. You can view the built version of this project at www.weatherapp.ericyj.com. To view my other projects, please visit [my personal website](http://www.ericyj.com).

*Please note:* The current temperature and other weather conditions are retrieved using a free weather API. The values may be very inaccurate sometimes. (e.g. sunset in Vancouver is 12:00am Eastern Time).
